    <h1>Video Transcript: The Power of Inclusive Storytelling</h1>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;00;10;26 - 00;00;44;02</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> What does inclusion really look like? It's not this. It's this. Something as simple as a caption can be the difference between confusion and connection. Yet we've grown so accustomed to them. They're easy to be overlooked. Right? But imagine watching a foreign film, or you're in a noisy cafe. Or better yet, you're in a quiet library where sound is off limits.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;00;44;25 - 00;01;19;12</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> It's those moments. Captions don't just help. They include the bridge gaps instead of building moats. But closed captioning didn't just happen by accident. It was a result of consideration. In 1976, a deaf American educator and advocate by the name of Malcolm Norwood helped launch the line 21 initiative, which reserved part of the TV signal for captions. He recognized that access alone just wasn't enough.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;01;20;02 - 00;01;52;09</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> What mattered most was thoughtful design that made people feel included. Captions weren't just about enabling access to content. They were about making viewers feel like the content was made for them specifically. And that's the heart of inclusion. Accessibility means you can engage. Inclusion means you want to engage because you were considered. Because your needs help shape the very experience you're partaking in.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;01;53;17 - 00;02;21;03</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> And that shift in mindset transforms a feature into a signal that someone belongs. And that is very powerful. Accessibility opens the door. But inclusion invites you in and says, We thought about you. Think about a time when someone anticipated your needs. It could be as simple as a server asking you about, does anyone have food allergies before making food recommendations?</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;02;23;00 - 00;02;49;14</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> That's the kind of awareness that creates better experiences for everyone. And when we design with people in mind, not as an afterthought, but as a starting point, we create better experiences for everyone. And that's a win win. Technology is at its best when it's human centered. Technology is at its best when it reflects the full spectrum of needs. The full spectrum of abilities.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;02;49;21 - 00;03;17;23</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> And the full spectrum of lived experiences. And here's the hard truth. What's accessible to us today may become a barrier for us tomorrow. Designing for inclusion isn't just about being generous or being compliant. It's about being wise. It's about being robust. It's about future proofing. It's about being a change maker. And that's all of the components of being inclusive.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;03;18;11 - 00;03;47;19</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> So when we design for inclusion, we don't just reach more people or cast a wider net. What we're actually doing is we're enabling those very same people to reach more people on their own, giving them back their level of autonomy, empowering them. So with that in mind, I would love to close with an example of assistive technology in real time by using my phone to read the last portion of the very same email that I sent over to you guys.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;03;48;18 - 00;03;57;24</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> I think it'd be a great way to bring this all together. Siri turn on VoiceOver. Thank you.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;03;59;11 - 00;04;29;02</span><span class="speaker">Siri:</span> Don't mention it. For me, information isn't just about compliance or removing barriers. It's about intentionally designing experiences that empower every user to thrive. I bring a deep commitment to building products that are accessible, inclusive and equitable because this work isn't just important. It's personal. With hands on experience supporting communities who rely on accessible tools. I lead with empathy, strategy and a user first mindset.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;04;29;17 - 00;04;46;23</span><span class="speaker">VoiceOver:</span> I'm adaptable, coachable and driven by purpose. Thank you again for your time and consideration. I'd be honored to contribute to a group with such a talented team. Let's build that future together. Best regards, Olivier Lamy.</p>

    <p><span class="timestamp">00;04;46;23 - 00;04;51;12</span><span class="speaker">Olivier:</span> Thank you so much, guys, for the time.</p>
